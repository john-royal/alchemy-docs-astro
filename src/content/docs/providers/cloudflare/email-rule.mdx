description: Learn how to create and manage email routing rules that define how emails are processed in Cloudflare.

Create email routing rules that define how emails sent to your domain are processed. Rules are evaluated in priority order (lower number = higher priority).

<Aside type="caution">
Email Routing resources do not work with `wrangler login` (OAuth tokens) due to permission limitations. You must use an API token instead with the following scopes:

- **Zone:Read** - to read zone information
- **Zone:Edit** - to manage email routing settings

See the [Cloudflare Auth guide](../../guides/cloudflare-auth) for details on setting up API token authentication.

## Minimal Example

Forward emails to a specific address:

```ts
import { EmailRule } from "alchemy/cloudflare";

await EmailRule("info-forwarding", {
  zone: "example.com",
  name: "Forward info emails",
  matchers: [
    {
      type: "literal",
      field: "to",
      value: "info@example.com",
    },
  ],
  actions: [
    {
      type: "forward",
      value: ["admin@company.com"],
    },
  ],
});
```

## Forward to Multiple Addresses

Forward emails to multiple destination addresses:

```ts
import { EmailRule } from "alchemy/cloudflare";

await EmailRule("support-forwarding", {
  zone: "example.com",
  name: "Support team forwarding",
  matchers: [
    {
      type: "literal",
      field: "to",
      value: "support@example.com",
    },
  ],
  actions: [
    {
      type: "forward",
      value: ["support@company.com", "backup@company.com"],
    },
  ],
});
```

## Process with Worker

Route emails to a Cloudflare Worker for custom processing:

```ts
import { EmailRule } from "alchemy/cloudflare";

await EmailRule("worker-processing", {
  zone: "example.com",
  name: "Process with Worker",
  priority: 1,
  matchers: [
    {
      type: "literal",
      field: "to",
      value: "webhook@example.com",
    },
  ],
  actions: [
    {
      type: "worker",
      value: ["email-processor"],
    },
  ],
});
```

## Drop Unwanted Emails

Create rules to drop/reject specific emails:

```ts
import { EmailRule } from "alchemy/cloudflare";

await EmailRule("spam-filter", {
  zone: "example.com",
  name: "Drop spam emails",
  priority: 0, // High priority
  matchers: [
    {
      type: "literal",
      field: "subject",
      value: "SPAM",
    },
  ],
  actions: [
    {
      type: "drop",
    },
  ],
});
```

## Multiple Matchers

Create rules with multiple matching conditions:

```ts
import { EmailRule } from "alchemy/cloudflare";

await EmailRule("vip-routing", {
  zone: "example.com",
  name: "VIP customer routing",
  priority: 1,
  matchers: [
    {
      type: "literal",
      field: "to",
      value: "sales@example.com",
    },
    {
      type: "literal",
      field: "from",
      value: "important@partner.com",
    },
  ],
  actions: [
    {
      type: "forward",
      value: ["vip-sales@company.com"],
    },
  ],
});
```

## Multiple Actions

Rules can perform multiple actions:

```ts
import { EmailRule } from "alchemy/cloudflare";

await EmailRule("complex-routing", {
  zone: "example.com",
  name: "Forward and log emails",
  matchers: [
    {
      type: "literal",
      field: "to",
      value: "orders@example.com",
    },
  ],
  actions: [
    {
      type: "forward",
      value: ["sales@company.com"],
    },
    {
      type: "worker",
      value: ["order-logger"],
    },
  ],
});
```

## Rule Priority

Control rule evaluation order with priority:

```ts
import { EmailRule } from "alchemy/cloudflare";

// High priority rule (evaluated first)
await EmailRule("urgent-rule", {
  zone: "example.com",
  name: "Urgent emails",
  priority: 0,
  matchers: [
    {
      type: "literal",
      field: "subject",
      value: "URGENT",
    },
  ],
  actions: [
    {
      type: "forward",
      value: ["urgent@company.com"],
    },
  ],
});

// Lower priority rule (evaluated later)
await EmailRule("general-rule", {
  zone: "example.com",
  name: "General emails",
  priority: 10,
  matchers: [
    {
      type: "literal",
      field: "to",
      value: "contact@example.com",
    },
  ],
  actions: [
    {
      type: "forward",
      value: ["general@company.com"],
    },
  ],
});
```

## Matcher Types

### Literal Matcher

Match exact string values in specific fields:

```ts
{
  type: "literal",
  field: "to",           // "to", "from", or "subject"
  value: "sales@example.com"
}
```

### All Matcher

Match all emails (typically used in catch-all rules):

```ts
{
  type: "all";
  // No field or value needed
}
```

## Action Types

### Forward Action

Forward emails to destination addresses:

```ts
{
  type: "forward",
  value: ["destination1@company.com", "destination2@company.com"]
}
```

### Worker Action

Process emails with a Cloudflare Worker:

```ts
{
  type: "worker",
  value: ["worker-script-name"]
}
```

### Drop Action

Drop/reject emails:

```ts
{
  type: "drop";
  // No value needed
}
```

## Properties

### Input Properties

- `zone` (string | Zone): Zone ID or Zone resource where the rule will be created
- `name` (string, optional): Name for the email routing rule. Defaults to "Email routing rule"
- `enabled` (boolean, optional): Whether the rule is enabled. Defaults to `true`
- `priority` (number, optional): Rule priority - lower numbers have higher priority. Defaults to `0`
- `matchers` (EmailMatcher[]): Array of matchers that define which emails this rule applies to
- `actions` (EmailAction[]): Array of actions to take when emails match this rule

### Output Properties

- `zoneId` (string): Zone ID where the rule is created
- `ruleId` (string): Rule ID
- `name` (string): Rule name
- `enabled` (boolean): Whether the rule is enabled
- `priority` (number): Rule priority
- `matchers` (EmailMatcher[]): Matchers for this rule
- `actions` (EmailAction[]): Actions for this rule
- `tag` (string): Rule tag

## Best Practices

### Rule Organization

- **Use Priorities**: Set appropriate priorities to control rule evaluation order
- **Descriptive Names**: Use clear names that explain what each rule does
- **Start Simple**: Begin with basic forwarding rules before adding complex logic

### Matcher Design

- **Be Specific**: Use specific matchers to avoid unintended matches
- **Test Thoroughly**: Test rules with sample emails to ensure they work correctly
- **Consider Edge Cases**: Think about variations in email formatting

### Action Configuration

- **Verify Destinations**: Ensure destination addresses are verified before creating rules
- **Multiple Backups**: Consider multiple forwarding addresses for important emails
- **Worker Testing**: Test Worker scripts thoroughly before using in production

## Rule Evaluation

Rules are processed in the following order:

1. **Priority Order**: Rules with lower priority numbers are evaluated first
2. **First Match**: Once a rule matches, its actions are executed
3. **Stop Processing**: No further rules are evaluated for that email
4. **Catch-All**: If no rules match, catch-all rules are evaluated

## Limitations

- Maximum of 200 routing rules per zone
- Matcher fields are limited to "to", "from", and "subject"
- Worker actions require an existing Cloudflare Worker script

## Troubleshooting

### Rule Not Matching

1. **Check Priority**: Ensure higher priority rules aren't catching emails first
2. **Verify Matchers**: Double-check matcher field and value exactness
3. **Test with Logs**: Use Worker actions to log matching attempts

### Actions Not Working

1. **Verify Destinations**: Check that forwarding addresses are verified
2. **Worker Errors**: Check Worker script logs for processing errors
3. **Rule Enabled**: Ensure the rule is enabled
