# MatchmakingRuleSet

The MatchmakingRuleSet resource allows you to define the rules and conditions for matchmaking in AWS GameLift, enabling you to create balanced game sessions for players. For more details, visit the [AWS GameLift MatchmakingRuleSets documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/userguide/).

## Minimal Example

Create a basic matchmaking rule set with required properties:

```ts
import AWS from "alchemy/aws/control";

const basicMatchmakingRuleSet = await AWS.GameLift.MatchmakingRuleSet("basicRuleSet", {
  Name: "BasicMatchmakingRules",
  RuleSetBody: JSON.stringify({
    Version: "1.0",
    Rules: [
      {
        Name: "SkillBasedMatch",
        Description: "Match players based on skill levels",
        Rule: {
          Type: "Matchmaking",
          Value: {
            Skill: {
              ComparisonType: "GreaterThan",
              Threshold: 1500
            }
          }
        }
      }
    ]
  }),
  Tags: [
    { Key: "Environment", Value: "Development" }
  ]
});
```

## Advanced Configuration

Configure a matchmaking rule set with additional rules and tags for more complex matchmaking scenarios:

```ts
const advancedMatchmakingRuleSet = await AWS.GameLift.MatchmakingRuleSet("advancedRuleSet", {
  Name: "AdvancedMatchmakingRules",
  RuleSetBody: JSON.stringify({
    Version: "1.0",
    Rules: [
      {
        Name: "SkillBasedMatch",
        Description: "Match players based on skill levels",
        Rule: {
          Type: "Matchmaking",
          Value: {
            Skill: {
              ComparisonType: "Between",
              Minimum: 1200,
              Maximum: 1800
            }
          }
        }
      },
      {
        Name: "RegionMatch",
        Description: "Match players in the same region",
        Rule: {
          Type: "Matchmaking",
          Value: {
            Region: {
              ComparisonType: "Equals",
              Value: "us-west-2"
            }
          }
        }
      }
    ]
  }),
  Tags: [
    { Key: "Game", Value: "Battle Royale" },
    { Key: "Environment", Value: "Production" }
  ]
});
```

## Special Use Case: Custom Matchmaking Logic

Create a matchmaking rule set that incorporates custom logic for matchmaking, such as party size and latency considerations:

```ts
const customMatchmakingRuleSet = await AWS.GameLift.MatchmakingRuleSet("customRuleSet", {
  Name: "CustomMatchmakingRules",
  RuleSetBody: JSON.stringify({
    Version: "1.0",
    Rules: [
      {
        Name: "PartySizeMatch",
        Description: "Match based on party size",
        Rule: {
          Type: "Matchmaking",
          Value: {
            PartySize: {
              ComparisonType: "Equals",
              Value: 4
            }
          }
        }
      },
      {
        Name: "LatencyMatch",
        Description: "Match players with low latency",
        Rule: {
          Type: "Matchmaking",
          Value: {
            Latency: {
              ComparisonType: "LessThan",
              Value: 100 // Latency in milliseconds
            }
          }
        }
      }
    ]
  }),
  Tags: [
    { Key: "Game", Value: "Team Shooter" },
    { Key: "Environment", Value: "Staging" }
  ],
  adopt: true // Adopt existing resource if it already exists
});
```
