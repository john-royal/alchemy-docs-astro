# ReportGroup

The ReportGroup resource lets you manage [AWS CodeBuild ReportGroups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/) for organizing and storing test reports generated by your builds.

## Minimal Example

Create a basic ReportGroup with the required Type and ExportConfig properties:

```ts
import AWS from "alchemy/aws/control";

const basicReportGroup = await AWS.CodeBuild.ReportGroup("basicReportGroup", {
  Type: "TEST",
  ExportConfig: {
    ExportConfigType: "S3",
    S3Destination: {
      Bucket: "my-report-bucket",
      Path: "reports/",
      Packaging: "ZIP"
    }
  }
});
```

## Advanced Configuration

Configure a ReportGroup with additional options including tags and the option to delete reports:

```ts
const advancedReportGroup = await AWS.CodeBuild.ReportGroup("advancedReportGroup", {
  Type: "TEST",
  ExportConfig: {
    ExportConfigType: "S3",
    S3Destination: {
      Bucket: "my-advanced-report-bucket",
      Path: "advanced-reports/",
      Packaging: "NONE"
    }
  },
  DeleteReports: true,
  Tags: [
    { Key: "Environment", Value: "Production" },
    { Key: "Project", Value: "MyApp" }
  ],
  Name: "MyAdvancedReportGroup"
});
```

## Custom Report Group with Adoption

Create a ReportGroup that adopts an existing resource and includes customized properties:

```ts
const customReportGroup = await AWS.CodeBuild.ReportGroup("customReportGroup", {
  Type: "CODE_COVERAGE",
  ExportConfig: {
    ExportConfigType: "S3",
    S3Destination: {
      Bucket: "my-custom-report-bucket",
      Path: "custom-reports/",
      Packaging: "ZIP"
    }
  },
  DeleteReports: false,
  Tags: [
    { Key: "Department", Value: "Engineering" }
  ],
  Name: "CustomReportGroup",
  adopt: true
});
```
