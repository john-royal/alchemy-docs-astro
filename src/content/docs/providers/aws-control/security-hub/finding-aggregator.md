# FindingAggregator

The FindingAggregator resource allows you to manage AWS SecurityHub FindingAggregators, which helps in aggregating and consolidating findings across multiple AWS accounts and regions. For more detailed information, refer to the [AWS SecurityHub FindingAggregators documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/latest/userguide/).

## Minimal Example

Create a basic FindingAggregator with required properties and one optional property.

```ts
import AWS from "alchemy/aws/control";

const findingAggregator = await AWS.SecurityHub.FindingAggregator("myFindingAggregator", {
  RegionLinkingMode: "ALL",
  Regions: ["us-east-1", "us-west-2"],
  adopt: true // Allow adopting existing resources
});
```

## Advanced Configuration

Configure a FindingAggregator with specific region linking modes and multiple regions.

```ts
const advancedAggregator = await AWS.SecurityHub.FindingAggregator("advancedAggregator", {
  RegionLinkingMode: "LINK_ACCOUNTS", // Aggregate findings from linked accounts
  Regions: ["eu-central-1", "ap-south-1"],
  adopt: true // Adopt existing resources if they are already present
});
```

## Use Case: Centralized Security Management

Set up a FindingAggregator to centralize security findings across different regions for a comprehensive security overview.

```ts
const centralizedAggregator = await AWS.SecurityHub.FindingAggregator("centralizedAggregator", {
  RegionLinkingMode: "ALL", // Link all regions for comprehensive aggregation
  Regions: ["us-east-1", "us-west-1", "ap-northeast-1"],
  adopt: false // Fail if the resource already exists
});
```

## Use Case: Multi-Account Security Insights

Create a FindingAggregator that supports multi-account security insights by linking specified regions.

```ts
const multiAccountAggregator = await AWS.SecurityHub.FindingAggregator("multiAccountAggregator", {
  RegionLinkingMode: "LINK_ACCOUNTS", // Link accounts for aggregated findings
  Regions: ["us-east-1", "us-west-2", "ca-central-1"],
  adopt: true // Adopt if the resource already exists
});
```
