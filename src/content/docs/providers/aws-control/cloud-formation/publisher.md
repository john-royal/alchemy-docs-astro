# Publisher

The Publisher resource lets you manage [AWS CloudFormation Publishers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/latest/userguide/) which are used to publish CloudFormation templates for public use.

## Minimal Example

Create a basic CloudFormation Publisher with the required properties and an optional connection ARN:

```ts
import AWS from "alchemy/aws/control";

const cloudFormationPublisher = await AWS.CloudFormation.Publisher("myPublisher", {
  AcceptTermsAndConditions: true,
  ConnectionArn: "arn:aws:codestar-connections:us-west-2:123456789012:connection/abcd1234-56ef-78gh-90ij-klmnopqrstuv"
});
```

## Advanced Configuration

Configure a CloudFormation Publisher with the adoption property set to true, allowing it to adopt existing resources:

```ts
const existingPublisher = await AWS.CloudFormation.Publisher("existingPublisher", {
  AcceptTermsAndConditions: true,
  adopt: true
});
```

## Publish with Connection

Create a CloudFormation Publisher that specifies a connection ARN for integration with other AWS services:

```ts
const connectedPublisher = await AWS.CloudFormation.Publisher("connectedPublisher", {
  AcceptTermsAndConditions: true,
  ConnectionArn: "arn:aws:codestar-connections:us-east-1:987654321098:connection/wxyz9876-54ts-32rq-10po-nmabcdefghij"
});
```
