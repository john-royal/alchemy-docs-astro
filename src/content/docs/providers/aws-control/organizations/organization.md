# Organization

The Organization resource lets you manage your AWS Organizations, which allows you to consolidate multiple AWS accounts into an organization that you can centrally manage. For more information, visit the [AWS Organizations Organizations documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/).

## Minimal Example

Create a basic AWS Organization with the default feature set.

```ts
import AWS from "alchemy/aws/control";

const organization = await AWS.Organizations.Organization("myOrganization", {
  FeatureSet: "ALL" // Optional: Choose between "ALL" or "CONSOLIDATED_BILLING"
});
```

## Advanced Configuration

Configure an organization that adopts an existing resource if it already exists.

```ts
const existingOrganization = await AWS.Organizations.Organization("existingOrg", {
  FeatureSet: "ALL",
  adopt: true // Optional: If true, adopts existing resource instead of failing
});
```

## Managing Features

Create an organization with specific feature set configurations.

```ts
const featureConfiguredOrganization = await AWS.Organizations.Organization("featureOrg", {
  FeatureSet: "CONSOLIDATED_BILLING" // Use consolidated billing features
});
```

## Handling Organization Updates

Update an existing organization to change its feature set.

```ts
const updatedOrganization = await AWS.Organizations.Organization("updateOrg", {
  FeatureSet: "ALL", // Changing feature set from CONSOIDATED_BILLING to ALL
  adopt: true
});
```
